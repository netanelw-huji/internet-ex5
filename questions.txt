1. can your app suffer from XSS? if yes - how can you fix it? if not - why not?
it doesn't seem to suffer from XSS. the reason is that I don't use unsanitized input
and reflect it to the output. The only reflected input is in the list itself,
and Angular's bind seem to escape problematic characters.


2. can your app suffer from CSRF? if yes - how can you fix it? if not - why not?
yes, it can. as long as the cookie hasn't expired, an attacker can forge a request
and use the existing cookie in the victim's browser.
A way to fix it can be using tokens, i.e. a secret value sent to the user for identification,
but not saved as a cookie, so an outsider can't know it's value.
